# droid-depot-bt
A bluetooth controller for Droid Depot droids

Use the interface to initiate the bluetooth connection, and then input how often you'd like the program to send a random noise/light command to the connected droid. 

Note: If the bluetooth connection fails, you might need to enable the Web Bluetooth API in your browser.
To do so, navigate to `brave://flags/` and search for `Web Bluetooth API` and enable it.
